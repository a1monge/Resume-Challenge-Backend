## About

This repository contains the backend infrastructure for the Resume Challenge/ It manages the deployment of various AWS resources, including Lambda functions, API Gateway, and CloudFront distribution, to support the application's functionality. I also include CI/CD Pipeline functionalities to update my Lambda code automatically.

- **Infrastructure as Code**: Utilizes Terraform for provisioning and managing AWS resources.
- **Workflow**: Automatically redeploys lambda code whenever a change is made.
- **AWS Lambda**: Deploys serverless functions for backend processing.
